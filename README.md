# Myproject


The programs 'Saikoro Koro for 4 Players V2' and 'DiceWars (5)' were used for a dice-rolling game project. I was utilizing these on Google Colab to implement and train an AI with reinforcement learning.

Separately, the programs 'Generate FEN,' 'Generate boarddata,' and 'ChessSystemV5' were developed for a game of Othello. These were built in Visual Studio Code and require the StockFish engine to be installed in order to run.
